## **Symmary**
My job is a assistant in a medical hematological laboratory.  
It's not boring, but working with sick patients leads to emotional burnout.  
I have no experience in Front-End Development, this is what I want to learn.  
I know that after a lot of effort, everything is possible, and i will write high level code.  
Not becoming Hokage if you surrender!
